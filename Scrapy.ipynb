With this barrel selection from Red Willow, Forgotten Hills and Les Collines vineyards, the aromas are reserved, with notes of black pepper, dried stem, herb, lavender and smoked meat. The palate is packed full of tart fruit flavors that stretch out on the finish. Quite firm tannins back it up. Most Washington wines you can pop and pour or wait a decade to enjoy. This is an exception, requiring significant time to see its best, but it is more than worth the wait. Drink after 2027, but it will have a long life beyond that, appearing near immortal.',\n",

With this 100% varietal, the aromas start out brooding, with notes of Red Vines candy, dark raspberry, herb and dark chocolate. Bright, vibrant, palate-coating, textured red fruit and barrel flavors follow. It shows a lovely sense of depth and intensity but still freshness, with a lingering finish capping it off.
